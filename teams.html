                <h2>2022 Teams</h2>

                <h3>Learn about each of the 10 Formula One teams of the 2022 season!</h3>

                <p>
                    To get started, there are 10 teams in Formula 1. 
                    Each team has 2 drivers, making there be a total of 20 drivers in Formula One.
                    Teams can also be referred to as "constructors." 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the drivers compete with each other to
                    win their own individual races, the teams overall also compete to win the World Constructors Championship which 
                    basically is an award for who built the best car, or who had the best car throughout the season. 
                    Each individual Grand Prix also has a constructor winner, and that team is awarded a constructor's trophy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That means all of the engineers, mechanics, strategists, coaches, etc, 
                    are also part of the competition, not just the drivers. These hardworking
                    engineers are always overlooked and should be recognized!
                </p>
